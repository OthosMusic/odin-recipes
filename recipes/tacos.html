    <p><h3>Birria, a.k.a. tacos de birria, is a Mexican dish of meat (usually goat or beef) stewed in its braising liquid until it reaches a melt-in-your-mouth texture. Traditionally, it gets its flavor from dried chile peppers. Birria can be served alone as a stew or on corn tortillas.</p></h3>

    <p><h1>Directions</h1></p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p><h4>Step 1</h4> </p>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Fill a pot with water and bring to a boil.</p>
    <p><h4>Step 2</h4></p>
        <p>Start the sauce: Add guajillo, arbol, and ancho chile peppers to the boiling water; boil for 5 minutes. Remove pot from the heat and allow peppers to soak until cool. Drain, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water.</p>
     <p><h4>Step 3</h4></p>
        <p>Meanwhile, sear the meat: Rinse beef and pat dry with paper towels. Cut beef into chunks if desired, and season with salt and pepper.</p>
    <p><h4>Step 4</h4></p>
        <p>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat.</p>
    <p><h4>Step 5</h4></p>
        <p>While the beef is searing, continue the sauce: Line a heavy cast-iron grill pan or griddle with aluminum foil and place over high heat. Arrange tomatoes in a single layer on top. Grill until tomato skin is burned on all sides and begins to peel, 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
    <p><h4>Step 6</h4></p>
        <p>Place cooled chile peppers into a blender. Add vinegar, garlic, 2 teaspoons black pepper, cloves, cinnamon, cumin, thyme, marjoram, oregano, and salt in a blender. Pour in the reserved 1/4 cup of chile water and blend until smooth.</p>
    <p><h4>Step 7</h4></p>
        <p>Strain chile sauce through a mesh strainer and pour over browned meat in the Dutch oven, turning the roast so it is completely covered with sauce; cover with a lid.</p>
    <p><h4>Step 8</h4></p>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven, basting meat every 45 minutes with sauce, until birria begins to fall apart, 3 to 4 hours. Remove the lid and bake, uncovered, until birria is crispy on top, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven, cover with 2 layers of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes.</p>
    <p><h4>Step 9</h4></p>
        <p>Remove meat to a cutting board and strain off any fat from the sauce. Shred meat with two forks, then return meat to the pot and stir with the sauce to combine.</p>
    <p><h4>Step 10</h4></p>
        <p>Assemble and heat tacos: Fill each tortilla with birria and top with Mexican cheese, chopped onion, and cilantro. Warm tortillas on a griddle, flipping until both sides are crispy and cheese is melted.</p>
    <p><h4>Step 11</h4></p>
        <p>Serve with extra sauce on the side for dipping.</p>
